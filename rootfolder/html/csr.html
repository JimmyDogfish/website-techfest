    <!--COVID-19-->
    <P>We don't build castles on hills. With us architectural and construction practises are based on indigenous designs created by local architects and artisans. Local farmers and fishermen provide us with our food. Our local relationships provide us with information on the best fishing holes, diving spots, underground and pop-up events. Then again, we couldn't hope to care for you unless we first cared for our people, families, and communities. </P>
    
    <H3 id="location-heading">Education</H3>
    <P>Comfort Palms works in many remote areas where women, children, and young adults often face barriers to education. Our learning and education initiatives promote community development and help to shape a better future for local communities.</P>

    <H3 id="location-heading">Public Infrastructure</H3> 
    <P>We all realise that sustainability is about making the most of our natural resources and celebrating what's good in all of the locations where we operate, from our top management to our sustainability managers who drive initiatives, to our hosts at each property, to our guests. But we're also there when things aren't going well, providing vital funds and resources for disaster relief or much-needed public-sector renovations.</P>
  
    <H3 id="location-heading">Healthcare</H3>
   <P>A specific example of public infrastructure spending is hospital construction. Some destinations have inadequate health care, which is why one of our top categories for our Sustainability Fund is healthcare in communities. As a result, we are able to provide critical medical equipment to local hospitals, such as incubators for premature babies.</P>

<H3 id="location-heading">Clean water and Sanitation</H3>
<P>Another issue that many of our local communities face is a lack of clean water. We provide clean water and sanitation by combining educational programming with our expertise in filtering and bottling our own high-quality drinking water. Water access is a cross-cutting issue, and improved access means less single-use plastic in our communities.</P>

<section style="text-align:center">
    <div id="enviornment-content">
        <div id="overlay1">
            <div id="heading"> Enviornment <br>Giving back to the Earth</br> </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</section> 
<P>Every Comfort Palms property has an organic garden to help the environment by composting and building healthy soil. Our landscapes are made up of native and non-invasive plant varieties, many of which are key ingredients in our restaurants and spa treatments, as well as natural cleaning products created in our Earth Labs. We continue to investigate how we can keep our habitats healthy and their inhabitants (humans, hornbills, and hammerhead sharks) happy.</P>

<H3 id="location-heading">Designed to Blend in</H3>
<P>We drive sophisticated design without being formulaic by localising our brand standards and aiming for LEED Silver certification for all new hotels. Each property can take on a life and personality of its own by blending new ideas with traditional or locally inspired architecture and infusing its own touch.</P>

<H3 id="location-heading">Inside and out</H3> 
<P>Our responsible approach is guided by the Standards for Design and Construction, which bring economic value to owners through healthy rooms and ventilation, energy efficiency in lighting and equipment, renewable energy production, water efficiency and recycling, passive architecture, building management systems, ozone protection, and efficient glazing and building envelopes. Local and sustainable building materials may include certified wood, recycled and rapidly renewable materials, as well as natural fibres, fabrics, and flooring. When doors are opened, air conditioning in newer properties is programmed to turn off automatically, instantly lowering energy consumption.</P>

            <div id="heading">On land</div>
            <p id="paragraph-text" style="position: absolute;margin-top: 200px;margin-left: 450px;">Our beautiful terrestrial habitats add value to everyoneâ€™s experience<br>(whether human, bee or hornbill), which is why we help them thrive. We support <br> various projects targeting the restoration and conservation of natural<br>habitats such as forests and beaches and work with local farmers, <br>governments and NGOs. Within our resorts we limit chemical use and compost organic matter<br>to regenerate soil and give back to the land.</br></p>

<H3 id="location-heading">In the water</H3>
<P>The world's oceans are under threat and require help. We are restoring marine habitats by growing and replanting coral reefs, reducing overfishing through our purchasing policies, funding conservation research, planting seagrass, and protecting nesting turtles on our beaches. All water leaving our properties is treated to a safe standard, and we recycle water to irrigate our plants, ensuring that our operations benefit our aquatic ecosystems.</P>

<H3 id="location-heading">A world of wildlife</H3> 
<P>Wild animals do not want to be disturbed, which is why we try to leave them alone in their natural habitats and only intervene if we are certain we are helping and on the advice of experts. We have been able to improve the prospects of some critically endangered species by allocating a portion of our sustainability fund to wildlife projects.</P>
