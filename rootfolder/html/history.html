        <!--Reconnect-->
        <p id="paragraph-text">We've grown since our story began in 1995, but each chapter has been based on the same goal: to take you beyond destinations and into new experiences and cultures, so you can feel the meaning behind your travels. Whether you're a guest at one of our hotels or resorts, a home owner, or spending time at one of our spas, you'll see that being environmentally friendly and socially responsible is more than just a catchphrase. These are the elements that bring them all to life, while also promoting personal well-being and the health of our planet.</p>

        <p id="paragraph-text">The Comfort Palms ethos was established in 1995 with the opening of our first resort and a slew of questions. What if we could transport people beyond their destinations and reawaken their senses, allowing them to disconnect while remaining connected... to themselves, others, and the world around them? Our vision permeated everything we did, from how we designed our buildings to how we prepared our food and treated our guests and hosts.</p>

                    <p id="paragraph3-text" style="position: absolute;margin-top: 200px;margin-left: 70px;">Expert-led retreats at a variety of destinations will provide much-needed space to disconnect from daily life's storey, reconnect with what counts, and explore new possibilities. Time will slow down until joy springs up again from your toes through guided activities, therapies, and workshops ranging from dance and detox to self-discovery.</p>
<p id="paragraph3-text" style="position: absolute;margin-top: 350px;margin-left: 70px;">Looking ahead, we've got plenty of ideas for ways to make your stay even more unique. Which reminds us to tie a virtual knot in our hanky and return here soon to update our storey!</p>

            <p>From the top of a mountain to the bottom of a valley. In 2015, we turned up at a 19th-century quinta (wine estate) in Portugal’s Douro Valley. This was our first foray into Europe, as well as our first non-villa offering. 
                We also expanded our Comfort Palms Residences offering from Vietnam's Con Dao to France's world-famous ski resort Courchevel. Comfort Palms Residences have since become available for purchase in additional locations such as Fiji, Seychelles, Ibiza, and Turkey, with many more on the way, including Austria, Switzerland, London, Belize, and Grenada. Each one represents a synergy of simple design and space, with the potential for appreciating returns in the future, as well as immediate in-resort benefits and additional exclusive benefits when staying at other Comfort Palms resorts around the world.</p>

            <p>With 2021 shining a light on how valuable "we time" with family and friends is, we're ensuring guests don't waste a moment in 2022 by improving the quality and diversity of our properties and experiences.
A restored palazzo in the heart of ancient Rome, a Maldives tropical paradise encompassing three white-sanded private islands, and ski-on/ski-off suites and residences in the stylish Swiss village of Crans will all entice guests to enjoy the beautiful surroundings and wellness lifestyle that our brand continues to promote. Comfort Palms Southern Dunes, The Red Sea is one of two inland locations that, along with coastal and marine initiatives, comprise The Red Sea Project on Saudi Arabia's west coast.</p>
