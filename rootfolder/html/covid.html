    <p id="paragraph-text">We continue to live by our responsible and caring values, which means adhering to our already high hygiene, sanitization, and cleaning standards. We have listed some of the extra steps we have taken in addition to these rigorous routines to reflect the advice and guidance of the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local health authorities on a country-by-country basis to ensure that what we are doing is correct, comprehensive, and effective.</p>
   
    <h3 id="heading-covid" style="background-image: url('../img/rainbow-underline.svg');background-repeat: no-repeat;background-size: 82vh 0.3em;background-position: left bottom 5px; ">Public Spaces and Facilities</h3>

   <p id="paragraph-text">Attain the objective protocols, improved training protocols, food handling standards and sanitation guidelines, and a new service approach in restaurants and host cafes. Reimagined minibars filled with healthy snacks and drinks based on each guest's needs prior to arrival, more unusual private dining and destination options, enhanced in-villa dining, and much more live cooking channels at our restaurants - all appropriately spaced out to avoid crowding.</P>

<p id="paragraph-text">Our hosts' health and well-being remain our top priorities, as does providing a safe environment for them to work in while caring for our guests. To that end, all hosts on duty will wear face masks and other protective equipment as needed and as mandated by local governments. All hosts at our properties practise social distancing, and information about personal hygiene and cleaning procedures is clearly communicated and displayed in host areas.
Our highest priority as a community with wellness at its core is our duty of care to your health, safety, and well-being. Finally, we will do everything we can to assist you in doing what you believe is best for you and your loved ones.
