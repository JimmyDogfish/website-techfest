    <paragraph id="paragraph-text">We continue to live by our responsible and caring values, which means adhering to our already high hygiene, sanitization, and cleaning standards. We have listed some of the extra steps we have taken in addition to these rigorous routines to reflect the advice and guidance of the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and local health authorities on a country-by-country basis to ensure that what we are doing is correct, comprehensive, and effective.</P>
   
    <H3 id="location-heading">Public Spaces and Facilities:</H3> 
    <paragraph id="paragraph-text">Sanitation of high touch surfaces and high traffic areas such as receptions, welcome lounges, and waiting areas, restaurants and related facilities, washrooms, libraries, boutiques, experience centres, and meeting rooms on a regular basis.</P>
 
   <H3 id="location-heading">Food and Beverage:</H3>
   <paragraph id="paragraph-text">Attain the objective protocols, improved training protocols, food handling standards and sanitation guidelines, and a new service approach in restaurants and host cafes. Reimagined minibars filled with healthy snacks and drinks based on each guest's needs prior to arrival, more unusual private dining and destination options, enhanced in-villa dining, and much more live cooking channels at our restaurants - all appropriately spaced out to avoid crowding.</P>

<H3 id="location-heading">Guest Rooms:</H3>
<paragraph id="paragraph-text">Improved protocols for handling guest items and laundry, as well as additional cleaning processes for daily housekeeping service during the stay and after departure.</P>

<H3 id="location-heading">Spas and Fitness Centers:</H3>
<paragraph id="paragraph-text">Cleaning and sanitization of treatment rooms, facilities, and all equipment between each appointment; wet facilities accessible only by prior appointment; reduction or removal of high-touch items; and additional deep cleaning of all surfaces, as well as improved laundry handling protocols.</P>

<H2 id="location-heading">Taking Care of our Hosts</H2>
<p>Our hosts' health and well-being remain our top priorities, as does providing a safe environment for them to work in while caring for our guests. To that end, all hosts on duty will wear face masks and other protective equipment as needed and as mandated by local governments. All hosts at our properties practise social distancing, and information about personal hygiene and cleaning procedures is clearly communicated and displayed in host areas.<p>
<p> Our highest priority as a community with wellness at its core is our duty of care to your health, safety, and well-being. Finally, we will do everything we can to assist you in doing what you believe is best for you and your loved ones.</p>
