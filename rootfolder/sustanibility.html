    <!--Reconnect-->
    <p>No plastic straws since 2016 and millions of plastic bottles eliminated every year thanks to producing and bottling our own drinking water (in glass bottles) on site. Plans are now well underway to eliminate the rest and we encourage our guests to join in too. Our audacious goal: to be completely free of plastic by the year 2022.</p>
    <p>In 2018 alone, 5,150,000 plastic items were eliminated (including 1,122,248 coffee capsules, 52,316 plastic bags, 26,435 toothbrushes and 462,282 bits of packaging). And 1.8 million single-use plastic bottles were replaced group-wide in 2019.</p>
    <p>In 2019, we reached out to our suppliers asking to deliver food and goods without plastic containers and seek safer alternatives as part of our pledge to the Global Tourism Plastics Initiative. </p>
<p>In 2020, we are in partnership with the Global Tourism Plastics Initiative to work with suppliers to seek safer alternatives and address the root causes of plastic pollution.</p>
<p>In 2021, Comfort Palms Hotels Resorts Spas is the first hospitality brand to collaborate with the United States Coalition on Sustainability and SustainChain™ as part of an ambitious Plastic Free 2022 strategy to remove and avoid all virgin plastic materials from its hotel and spa operations.</p>

            <!--Reconnect-->
            <p>The Comfort Palms approach places a premium on environmental and social responsibility. As a result, we have joined individuals, travel companies, and other organisations in declaring a climate emergency and emphasising the seriousness of the human consequences of climate change. Many of these are felt disproportionately by communities in the global south, as well as by current and future generations.</p>
